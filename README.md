# Welcome!

This is my personal website, its the second iteration of it. The first one was a pretty standard, multi-page format kind of deal. I thought I would be spending more time on it than I actually do, so I had some sections for like, a blog and other things that I thought I would regularly contribute to, but it just ended up sitting empty, which was kind of lame.

Its still in the works, so forgive any weirdness.

## Game of Life 
I got the code for the Game of Life off this codepen by Robert Spatz:

I had to make some alterations to make it work / look the way I wanted to, but I'm grateful for the code available online!
